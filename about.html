        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Founded in 2016, CodeFactory Wien follows the concept of programming boot camps of Anglo-American countries. Our goal is to provide time-efficient and very practice-oriented training with the aim of the fastest possible career entry as a junior
            developer. Our courses are tailored to newcomers, people who want to change careers in the second or third educational path as well as people who are interested in an application-oriented education.</p>
        <p>We are more than just a CodeSchool. We are a community, a place to study, laugh, make friends and just spend time. A place where after work the fun is not over. We want to give our students more than just to teach them how to be great at programming.
            We want to be a meeting place where the scene networks, where events take place and where you talk about over a gin and tonic about your latest project. Therefore, in addition to our large, modern location right on the Naschmarkt, we also
            offer numerous specials and goodies for our students so that your time in the CodeFactory is and remains unforgettable.

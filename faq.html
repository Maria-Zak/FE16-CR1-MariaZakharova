        <p>The CodeFactory Full-stack Web-development Course is very intensive, full-time study which prepares you for work as a web-developer in the real world. Build a solid base of fundamental programming skills which will enable you to further upgrade
            your professional profile.</p>
        <p> You will receive high-quality feedback by experienced programmers with many years of teaching behind their backs. We will teach you hands-on programming, which you must apply in responsive, functional projects, directly applicable in the real
            world, resulting in a solid, real portfolio which will enable you to confidently apply for developer jobs. You will learn to adopt the problem-solving mindset of a coder – not only learning how to use separate technologies, but also how to
            integrate them in practical, project-oriented applications in order to solve particular problems.</p>
        <p>Remember that the months of hard work you will put into our Full-stack course are just the beginning! It is crucial you continue learning and improving yourself constantly! If you really want a career change – remember coding is a way of life!
            We are here to support you with your motivation! It is possible to learn on your own, but how many people manage to do it? We will provide the right environment to support your hard work and motivation! Be together with other like-minded people,
            encourage each-other, work in groups and journey towards the world of programming together!</p>
